# 4.0 - Deploying a VM for the client
These steps include the deployment process for the client VM, an Ubuntu Desktop running on KVM.

Current state assumption:
* The desktop VM is running Ubuntu Desktop 18.04.2
* The username is `pid` with the password of `pid`
* The user is in the sudoers file and otherwise unrestricted.
* The NoMachine remote control software (server mode) is installed and running within the VM.
* The IP addressing is 192.168.120.1xx, where xx is the student server number.


## Download and Install the client software components
These applications are used by the students in class.

1. Logon to the VM using the NoMachine client via the SSH Tunnel. NoMachine server listens on TCP/4000. Redirect an appropriate port to the VM's IP address on port 4000 to access the VM.

2. Login to the VM as the user `pid` using the password `password`.

3. Open the terminal called "Konsole". Do not use the one called "Terminal" because it doesn't work properly.

4. In the Konsole window, update apt and install the following packages:
```
ssh root@<hostname>
```
